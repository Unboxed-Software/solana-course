# Solana Development Course

## About

This course is designed to be the absolute best starting point for Web Developers looking to learn Web3 Development. Solana is the ideal network for starting your Web3 journey because of its high speed, low cost, energy efficiency, and more. 

This course is being made publicly available upon completion of the first of four planned modules. We'll update the list of available lessons in the [Get Started](#get-started) section below as they're completed. If you'd like to help out, have a look [how you can contribute](#contribute-to-the-course).

The first two modules will primarily focus on client-side Solana development whereas the second two modules will focus on developing programs on the Solana network. Dive into the available lessons in the [Get Started](#get-started) section below, or have a look at the full [Course Map](./course-map.md) for details about what's to come.
