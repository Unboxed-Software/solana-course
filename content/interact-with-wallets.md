# TL;DR

- **Wallets** store your secret key and handle secure transaction signing
- **Hardware wallets** store your secret key on a separate device
- **Software wallets** use your computer for secure storage
- Software wallets are often **browser extensions** that facilitate connecting to websites
- Solana’s **Wallet-Adapter library** simplifies the support of wallet browser extensions, allowing you to build websites that can request a user’s wallet address and propose transactions for them to sign

# Overview

## Wallets

In the previous two lessons we discussed keypairs. Keypairs are used to locate accounts and sign transactions. While the public key of a keypair is perfectly safe to share, the secret key should always be kept in a secure location. If a user’s secret key is exposed, then a malicious actor could drain their account of all assets and execute transactions with the authority of that user.

A “wallet” refers to anything that stores a secret key in order to keep it secure. These secure storage options can generally be described as either “hardware” or “software” wallets. Hardware wallets are storage devices that are separate from your computer. Software wallets are application you can install on your existing device(s).

Software wallets often come in the form of a browser extension. This makes it possible for websites to interact easily with the wallet. Such interactions are usually limited to:

1. Seeing the wallet’s public key (address)
2. Submitting transactions for a user's approval
3. Sending an approved transaction to the network

Once a transaction is submitted, the end user can “confirm” the transaction and send it to the network with their “signature.”

Signing transactions requires using your secret key. By letting a site submit a transaction to your wallet and having the wallet handle the signing, you ensure that you never expose your secret key to the website. Instead, you only share the secret key with the wallet application.

Unless you’re creating a wallet application yourself, your code should never need to ask a user for their secret key. Instead, you can ask users to connect to your site using a reputable wallet.

## Phantom Wallet

One of the most widely used software wallets in the Solana ecosystem is [Phantom](https://phantom.app). Phantom supports a few of the most popular browsers and has a mobile app for connecting on the go. You’ll likely want your decentralized applications to support multiple wallets, but this course will focus on Phantom.

## Solana’s Wallet-Adapter

Solana’s Wallet-Adapter is a suite of libraries you can use to simplify the process of supporting wallet browser extensions.

Solana’s Wallet-Adapter comprises multiple modular packages. The core functionality is found in `@solana/wallet-adapter-base` and `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`.

There are also packages that provide components for common UI frameworks. In this lesson and throughout this course, we’ll be using components from `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`.

Finally, there are packages that are adapters for specific wallets, including Phantom. You can use `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets` to include all of the supported wallets, or you can choose a specific wallet package like `@solana/wallet-adapter-phantom`.

### Install Wallet-Adapter Libraries

When adding wallet support to an existing react app, you start by installing the appropriate packages. You’ll need `@solana/wallet-adapter-base`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`, the package(s) for the wallet(s) you want to support, and `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui` if you plan to use the provided react components, e.g.

```
npm install @solana/wallet-adapter-base \
    @solana/wallet-adapter-react \
    @solana/wallet-adapter-phantom \
    @solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui
```

### Connect To Wallets

`@solana/wallet-adapter-react` allows us to persist and access wallet connection states through hooks and context providers, namely:

- `useWallet`
- `WalletProvider`
- `useConnection`
- `ConnectionProvider`

For these to work properly, any use of `useWallet` and `useConnection` should be wrapped in `WalletProvider` and `ConnectionProvider`. One of the best ways to ensure this is to wrap your entire app in `ConnectionProvider` and `WalletProvider`:

```tsx
import { NextPage } from 'next'
import { FC, ReactNode } from "react"
import { ConnectionProvider, WalletProvider } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react'
import { PhantomWalletAdapter } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-phantom'
import * as web3 from '@solana/web3.js'

export const Home: NextPage = (props) => {
    const endpoint = web3.clusterApiUrl('devnet')
    const wallet = new PhantomWalletAdapter()

    return (
        <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
            <WalletProvider wallets={[wallet]}>
                <p>Put the rest of your app here</p>
            </WalletProvider>
        </ConnectionProvider>
    )
}
```

Note that `ConnectionProvider` requires an `endpoint` property and that `WalletProvider` requires a `wallets` property. We’re continuing to use the endpoint for the Devnet cluster, and for now we’re only using the `PhantomWalletAdapter` for `wallets`.

At this point you can connect with `wallet.connect()`, which will effectively instruct the wallet to prompt the user for permission to view their public key and request approval for transactions.

![Screenshot of wallet connection prompt](../assets/wallet-connect-prompt.png)

While you could do this in a `useEffect` hook, you’ll usually want to provide more sophisticated functionality. For example, you may want users to be able to choose from a list of supported wallets, or disconnect after they’ve already connected.

### `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`

You can create custom components for this, or you can leverage components provided by `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`. The simplest way to provide extensive options is to use `WalletModalProvider` and `WalletMultiButton`:

```tsx
import { NextPage } from 'next'
import { FC, ReactNode } from "react"
import { ConnectionProvider, WalletProvider } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react'
import { WalletModalProvider, WalletMultiButton } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui';
import { PhantomWalletAdapter } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-phantom'
import * as web3 from '@solana/web3.js'

const Home: NextPage = (props) => {
    const endpoint = web3.clusterApiUrl('devnet')
    const wallet = new PhantomWalletAdapter()

    return (
        <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
            <WalletProvider wallets={[wallet]}>
                <WalletModalProvider>
                    <WalletMultiButton />
                    <p>Put the rest of your app here</p>
                </WalletModalProvider>
            </WalletProvider>
        </ConnectionProvider>
    )
}

export default Home
```

The `WalletModalProvider` adds functionality for presenting a modal screen for users to select which wallet they’d like to use. The `WalletMultiButton` changes behavior to match the connection status:

![Screenshot of multi button select wallet option](../assets/multi-button-select-wallet.png)

![Screenshot of connect wallet modal](../assets/connect-wallet-modal.png)

![Screenshot of multi button connect options](../assets/multi-button-connect.png)

![Screenshot of multi button connected state](../assets/multi-button-connected.png)

You can also use more granular components if you need more specific functionality:

- `WalletConnectButton`
- `WalletModal`
- `WalletModalButton`
- `WalletDisconnectButton`
- `WalletIcon`

### Access Account Info

Once your site is connected to a wallet, `useConnection` will retrieve a `Connection` object and `useWallet` will get the `WalletContextState`. `WalletContextState` has a property `publicKey` that is `null` when not connected to a wallet and has the public key of the user’s account when a wallet is connected. With a public key and a connection, you can fetch account info and more.

```tsx
import { useConnection, useWallet } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react'
import { LAMPORTS_PER_SOL } from '@solana/web3.js'
import { FC, useEffect, useState } from 'react'

export const BalanceDisplay: FC = () => {
    const [balance, setBalance] = useState(0)
    const { connection } = useConnection()
    const { publicKey } = useWallet()

    useEffect(() => {
        if (!connection || !publicKey) { return }

        connection.getAccountInfo(publicKey).then(info => {
            setBalance(info.lamports)
        })
    }, [connection, publicKey])

    return (
        <div>
            <p>{publicKey ? `Balance: ${balance / LAMPORTS_PER_SOL} SOL` : ''}</p>
        </div>
    )
}
```

### Send Transactions

`WalletContextState` also provides a `sendTransaction` function that you can use to submit transactions for approval.

```tsx
const { publicKey, sendTransaction } = useWallet()
const { connection } = useConnection()

const sendSol = event => {
    event.preventDefault()

    const transaction = new web3.Transaction()
    const recipientPubKey = new web3.PublicKey(event.target.recipient.value)

    const sendSolInstruction = web3.SystemProgram.transfer({
        fromPubkey: publicKey,
        toPubkey: recipientPubKey,
        lamports: LAMPORTS_PER_SOL * 0.1
    })

    transaction.add(sendSolInstruction);
    sendTransaction(transaction, connection).then(sig => {
        console.log(sig)
    })
}
```

When this function is called, the connected wallet will display the transaction for the user’s approval. If approved, then the transaction will be sent.

# Demo

Let’s take the Ping program from last lesson and build a frontend that lets users approve a transaction that pings the program. As a reminder, the program’s public key is `ChT1B39WKLS8qUrkLvFDXMhEJ4F1XZzwUNHUt4AU9aVa` and the public key for the data account is `Ah9K7dQ8EHaZqcAsgBW8w37yN2eAy3koFmUn4x3CJtod`.

### 1. Download the Phantom browser extension and set it to Devnet

If you don’t already have it, download the [Phantom browser extension](https://phantom.app/download). At the time of writing, it supports Chrome, Brave, Firefox, and Edge browsers, so you’ll also need to have one of those browsers installed. Follow Phantom’s instructions for creating a new account and a new wallet.

Once you have a wallet, click the settings gear on the bottom right in the Phantom UI. Scroll down and click on the line item “Change Network” and select “Devnet.” This ensures that Phantom will be connected to the same network we’ll be using in this demo.

### 2. Download the starter code

Download the starter code for this project [here](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-ping-frontend/tree/starter). This project is a simple Next.js application. It’s mostly empty except for the `AppBar` component. We’ll build the rest throughout this demo.

You can see its current state with the command `npm run dev` in the console.

### 3. Wrap the app in context providers

To start, we’re going to create a new component to contain the various Wallet-Adapter providers that we’ll be using. Create a new file inside the `components` folder called `WalletContextProvider.tsx`.

Let’s start with some of the boilerplate for a functional component:

```tsx
import { FC, ReactNode } from 'react'

const WalletContextProvider: FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {

    return (

    )
}

export default WalletContextProvider
```

To properly connect to the user’s wallet, we’ll need a `ConnectionProvider`, `WalletProvider` and `WalletModalProvider`. Start by importing these components from `@solana/wallet-adapter-react` and `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`. Then add them to the `WalletContextProvider` component. Note that `ConnectionProvider` requires an `endpoint` parameter and `WalletProvider` requires an array of `wallets`. For now, just use an empty string and an empty array, respectively.

```tsx
import { FC, ReactNode } from 'react'
import { ConnectionProvider, WalletProvider } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react'
import { WalletModalProvider } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui"

const WalletContextProvider: FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {

    return (
        <ConnectionProvider endpoint={''}>
            <WalletProvider wallets={[]}>
                <WalletModalProvider>
                    { children }
                </WalletModalProvider>
            </WalletProvider>
        </ConnectionProvider>
    )
}

export default WalletContextProvider
```

The last things we need are an actual endpoint for `ConnectionProvider` and the supported wallets for `WalletProvider`.

For the endpoint, we’ll use the same `clusterApiUrl` function from the `@solana/web3.js` library that we’ve used before so you’ll need to import it. For the array of wallets you’ll also need to import the `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets` library.

After importing these libraries, create a constant `endpoint` that uses the `clusterApiUrl` function to get the url for Devnet. Then create a constant `wallets` and set it to an array that contains a newly constructed `PhantomWalletAdapter`. Finally, replace the empty string and empty array in `ConnectionProvider` and `WalletProvider`, respectively.

To complete this component, add `require('@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui/styles.css');` below your imports to ensure proper styling and behavior of the Wallet Adapter library components.

```tsx
import { FC, ReactNode } from 'react'
import { ConnectionProvider, WalletProvider } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react'
import { WalletModalProvider } from "@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui"
import * as web3 from '@solana/web3.js'
import * as walletAdapterWallets from '@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets'
require('@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui/styles.css')

const WalletContextProvider: FC<{ children: ReactNode }> = ({ children }) => {
    const endpoint = web3.clusterApiUrl('devnet')
    const wallets = [new walletAdapterWallets.PhantomWalletAdapter()]

    return (
        <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
            <WalletProvider wallets={wallets}>
                <WalletModalProvider>
                    { children }
                </WalletModalProvider>
            </WalletProvider>
        </ConnectionProvider>
    )
}

export default WalletContextProvider
```

### 4. Add wallet multi-button

Next let’s set up the Connect button. The current button is just a placeholder because rather than using a standard button or creating a custom component, we’ll be using Wallet-Adapter’s “multi-button.” This button interfaces with the providers we set up in `WalletContextProvider` and let’s users choose a wallet, connect to a wallet, and disconnect from a wallet. If you ever need more custom functionality, you can create a custom component to handle this.

Before we add the “multi-button,” we need to wrap the app in the `WalletContextProvider`. Do this by importing it in `index.tsx` and adding it after the closing `</Head>` tag:

```tsx
import { NextPage } from 'next'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'
import WalletContextProvider from '../components/WalletContextProvider'
import { AppBar } from '../components/AppBar'
import Head from 'next/head'
import { PingButton } from '../components/PingButton'

const Home: NextPage = (props) => {

    return (
        <div className={styles.App}>
            <Head>
                <title>Wallet-Adapter Example</title>
                <meta
                    name="description"
                    content="Wallet-Adapter Example"
                />
            </Head>
            <WalletContextProvider>
                <AppBar />
                <div className={styles.AppBody}>
                    <PingButton/>
                </div>
            </WalletContextProvider >
        </div>
    );
}

export default Home
```

If you run the app, everything should still look the same since the current button on the top right is still just a placeholder. To remedy this, open `AppBar.tsx` and replace `<button>Connect</button>` with `<WalletMultiButton/>`. You’ll need to import `WalletMultiButton` from `@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui`.

```tsx
import { FC } from 'react'
import styles from '../styles/Home.module.css'
import Image from 'next/image'
import { WalletMultiButton } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react-ui'

export const AppBar: FC = () => {
    return (
        <div className={styles.AppHeader}>
            <Image src="/solanaLogo.png" height={30} width={200} />
            <span>Wallet-Adapter Example</span>
            <WalletMultiButton/>
        </div>
    )
}
```

At this point, you should be able to run the app and interact with the multi-button at the top-right of the screen. It should now read, "Select Wallet." If you have the Phantom extension and are signed in, you should be able to connect your Phantom wallet to the site using this new button.

### 5. Create button to ping program

Now that our app can connect to the Phantom wallet, let’s make the “Ping!” button actually do something.

Start by opening the `PingButton.tsx` file. We’re going to replace the `console.log` inside of `onClick` with code that will create a transaction and submit it to the Phantom extension for the end user’s approval.

First, we need a connection, the wallet’s public key, and Wallet-Adapter’s `sendTransaction` function. To get this, we need to import `useConnection` and `useWallet` from `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`. While we’re here, let’s also import `@solana/web3.js` since we’ll need it to create our transaction.

```tsx
import { useConnection, useWallet } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react'
import * as web3 from '@solana/web3.js'
import { FC, useState } from 'react'
import styles from '../styles/PingButton.module.css'

export const PingButton: FC = () => {

	const onClick = () => {
		console.log('Ping!')
	}

	return (
		<div className={styles.buttonContainer} onClick={onClick}>
			<button className={styles.button}>Ping!</button>
		</div>
	)
}
```

Now use the `useConnection` hook to create a `connection` constant and the `useWallet` hook to create `publicKey` and `sendTransaction` constants.

```tsx
import { useConnection, useWallet } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react'
import * as web3 from '@solana/web3.js'
import { FC, useState } from 'react'
import styles from '../styles/PingButton.module.css'

export const PingButton: FC = () => {
    const { connection } = useConnection();
    const { publicKey, sendTransaction } = useWallet();

    const onClick = () => {
        console.log('Ping!')
    }

    return (
        <div className={styles.buttonContainer} onClick={onClick}>
            <button className={styles.button}>Ping!</button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

With that, we can fill in the body of `onClick`.

First, check that both `connection` and `publicKey` exist (if either does not then the user’s wallet isn’t connected yet).

Next, construct two instances of `PublicKey`, one for the program ID `ChT1B39WKLS8qUrkLvFDXMhEJ4F1XZzwUNHUt4AU9aVa` and one for the data account `Ah9K7dQ8EHaZqcAsgBW8w37yN2eAy3koFmUn4x3CJtod`.

Next, construct a `Transaction`, then a new `TransactionInstruction` that includes the data account as a writable key.

Next, add the instruction to the transaction.

Finally, call `sendTransaction`.

```tsx
const onClick = () => {
    if (!connection || !publicKey) { return }

    const programId = new web3.PublicKey(PROGRAM_ID)
    const programDataAccount = new web3.PublicKey(DATA_ACCOUNT_PUBKEY)
    const transaction = new web3.Transaction()

    const instruction = new web3.TransactionInstruction({
        keys: [
            {
                pubkey: programDataAccount,
                isSigner: false,
                isWritable: true
            },
        ],
        programId
    });

    transaction.add(instruction)
    sendTransaction(transaction, connection).then(sig => {
        console.log(sig)
    })
}
```

And that’s it! If you refresh the page, connect your wallet, and click the ping button, Phantom should present you with a popup for confirming the transaction.

### 6. Add some polish around the edges

There’s a lot you could do to make the user experience here even better. For example, you could change the UI to only show you the Ping button when a wallet is connected and display some other prompt otherwise. You could link to the transaction on Solana Explorer after a user confirms a transaction so they can easily go look at the transaction details. The more you experiment with it, the more comfortable you’ll get, so get creative!

If you need to spend some time looking at the full source code from this demo to understand all of this in context, check that out [here](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-ping-frontend).

# Challenge

Now it’s your turn to build something independently. Create an application that lets a user connect their Phantom wallet and send SOL to another account.

![Screenshot of Send Sol App](../assets/solana-send-sol-app.png)

1. You can build this from scratch or you can download the starter code [here](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-send-sol-frontend/tree/starter).
2. Wrap the starter application in the appropriate context providers.
3. In the form component, set up the transaction and send it to the user’s wallet for approval.
4. Get creative with the user experience. Add a link to let the user view the transaction on Solana Explorer or something else that seems cool to you!
