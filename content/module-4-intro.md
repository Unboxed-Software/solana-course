# Introduction to Module 4

Welcome to Module 4! In this module, we're going to dive deeper into the world of Solana program development, exploring more advanced concepts and techniques to help you create powerful programs. Building upon the foundations laid in the previous modules, we'll be taking your Solana programming skills to the next level, providing you with the tools and knowledge needed to tackle more complex projects.

The goal of this module is to expand your understanding of the Solana programming model and introduce you to a range of new topics, such as local program development, program-derived addresses, cross-program invocations, and program testing. These concepts will enable you to develop more sophisticated smart contracts and ensure that your programs are secure, reliable, and efficient.

The lessons in this module are designed to be sequential, building upon the concepts learned in previous lessons. However, you're welcome to revisit any topic to refresh your understanding or skip around if you feel confident in your grasp of the material.
