# How to approach the Program Security module

The goal of this module is to expose you to a wide variety of common security exploits that are unique to Solana development. We’ve heavily modeled this module off a public GitHub repository call Sealevel Attacks created by the great Armani Ferrante.

You might be thinking: “didn’t we have a security lesson in module 3?” Yes, we most certainly did. We wanted to make sure that anyone deploying programs to Mainnet right out of the gates had at least a basic understanding of security. And if that’s you then hopefully the fundamental principles you learned in that lesson have led to you avoiding some common Solana exploits on your own.

This module is meant to build on top of that lesson with two goals in mind:

1. To expand your awareness of the Solana programming model and the areas where you need to focus to close up security loopholes in your programs
2. To show you the array of tools provided by Anchor to help you keep your programs secure

If you went through the Basic Security lesson, the first few lessons should seem familiar. They largely cover topics we discussed in that lesson. After that, some of the attacks may seem new. We encourage you to go through all of them.

The last thing to call out is that the structure of this module is slightly different. Every lesson in this course allows you to choose whether to quickly go through the TL;DR or go through the entire lesson in-depth. As such, the lessons tend to be decently long so that readers can go deep on the material if they so choose. 

In this module, lessons are much shorter but there are more of them. And within each lesson, there is less prose and more code snippets. We’re hoping this makes it easy for you to skim all of them and really dive into the code on the ones that you don’t fully understand afterward.

As always, we appreciate feedback. Good luck digging in!
