## Welcome!

Welcome to the best starting point for developers looking to learn web3 and blockchain!

## What is web 3?

Typically, in older systems, people interact with each other through third party platforms:

- User accounts are stored on large platforms like Google, X (formerly known as Twitter), and Meta (Facebook, Instagram). These accounts can be removed at will by the companies, and items 'owned' by these accounts may be lost forever. 

- Accounts that store value - like payment cards, bank accounts, and trading accounts - are handled by large platforms like credit card companies, money transfer organizations, and stock exchanges. In many cases these companies take a piece (around 1% - 3%) of every transaction that occurs on their platforms. They may often slow transaction settlement down, in order to benefit the organization. In some cases the item being transferred may not belong to the recipient at all, but are rather held on the recipient's behalf.

Web3 is an evolution of the internet that allows people to transact directly with each other:

- Users own their own accounts, represented by their wallet.

- Transfers of value can occur directly between users.

- Tokens - representing currencies, digital art, event tickets, real estate, or whatever else - are fully under the custody of the user.

Common uses of web3 include:

- Selling good and services online with near-zero fees and instant settlement.

- Selling digital or physical items, ensuring that each item is genuine and that copies are distinguishable from original items. 

- Instant global payments, without the time and expense of 'money transfer' companies.

## What is Solana?

Solana is the first scalable Layer 1 blockchain.

Compared to older platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Solana is:

- Significantly faster - most transactions complete in a second or two.

- Massively cheaper - transaction fees (referred to as 'gas fees' in older networks) are typically $0.000025 (yes, far less than one penny) regardless of the value of what's being transferred.

- Highly decentralized, having one of the highest Nakamoto coefficient (decentralization score) of any proof-of-stake network.

Many of the common use cases on Solana are only possible on Solana, due to the high costs and slow transation times of older blockchains.

## What will I learn on this course?

In this course you'll:

 - Create web apps that allow people to log on using web3 wallets
 - Transfer tokens (like USDC, a token that represents US dollars) between people
 - Learn to integrate tools like Solana pay into your existing apps 
 - Build a film review application, that runs in real time on the Solana blockchain. You'll build both a web front end, and the backend program and database for the app
 - Mint large-scale NFT collections

And much more. We're keeping this course updated so as new tech joins the Solana ecosystem you'll find a course right here.

## What do I need before I start?

You **don't** need previous blockchain experience to follow this course! 

- Linux, Mac or a Windows computer. 
  Windows machines should have Windows Terminal WSL installed.
- Basic JavaScript / TypeScript programming experience. We'll also use some Rust but we'll explain the Rust as we go. 
- node.js 18 installed
- Rust installed
- Basic use of the command line 

## How is this course structured?

Modules cover a particular topic. These are broken down into individual lessons.

Each lesson starts by listing the lesson objectives - ie, what you'll be learning in the lesson.

Then there's a brief 'TL;DR' so that you can glance through, get a sense of what the lesson covers, and decide if the lesson is for you or not.

Then each lesson has three sections:

- **Overview** - the overview contains explanatory text, examples, and code snippets. You are _not_ expected to code along with any of the examples shown here. The goal is to simply read through and get initial exposure to the lesson topics.

- **Demo** - the demo is a tutorial-style project. You _absolutely should_ code along with this section. This is your second exposure to the content as well as your first opportunity to dive in and _do the thing_.

- **Challenge** - the challenge contains a similar project to the demo only instead of walking you through it, the lesson leaves just a few simple prompts that you should then take and implement independently.

This structure leans into a pedagogical technique call IWY loops. IWY stands for "I do, We do, You do." Each step along the way increases your exposure to the topic _and_ reduces the amount of handholding you're given.

## How do I use the course effectively?

The lessons here are very effective, but everyone comes from different backgrounds and aptitudes that can't be taken into account by static content. With that in mind, here are three recommendations for how to get the most out of the course:

1. **Be brutally honest with yourself** - this may sound a little vague, but being honest with yourself about how well you understand a certain topic is essential to mastering it. It's really easy to read a thing and think "yeah, yeah I get it," only to realize later that you actually didn't. Be honest with yourself while going through each lesson. Please don't hesitate to repeat sections if you need to or do outside research when the lesson phrasing doesn't quite work for you.

2. **Do every demo and challenge** - this supports the first point. It's pretty tough to lie to yourself about how well you know something when you make yourself try to do it. Do every demo and every challenge to test where you're at and repeat them as needed. We provide solution code for everything, but be sure to use it as a helpful resource rather than a crutch.

3. **Go above and beyond** - sounds cliche, I know, but don't just stop at what the demo and challenges ask you to do. Get creative! Take the projects and make them your own. Build past them. The more you practice the better you get.

Alright, that's it for my pep talk. Get after it!
