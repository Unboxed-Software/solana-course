title: PDA Sharing
objectives:
- Explain the security risks associated with PDA sharing
- Derive PDAs that have discrete authority domains
- Use Anchor’s `seeds` and `bump` constraints to validate PDA accounts
---

# TL;DR

- Using the same PDA for multiple authority domains opens your program up to the possibility of users accessing data and funds that don't belong to them
- Prevent the same PDA from being used for multiple accounts by using seeds that are user and/or domain-specific
- Use Anchor’s `seeds` and `bump` constraints to validate that a PDA is derived using the expected seeds and bump

# Overview

PDA sharing refers to using the same PDA as a signer across multiple users or domains. Especially when using PDAs for signing, it may seem appropriate to use a global PDA to represent the program. However, this opens up the possibility of account validation passing but a user being able to access funds, transfers, or data not belonging to them.

## Insecure global PDA

In the example below, the `authority` of the `vault` account is a PDA derived using the `mint` address stored on the `pool` account. This PDA is passed into the instruction as the `authority` account to sign for the transfer tokens from the `vault` to the `withdraw_destination`.

Using the `mint` address as a seed to derive the PDA to sign for the `vault` is insecure because multiple `pool` accounts could be created for the same `vault` token account, but a different `withdraw_destination`. By using the `mint` as a seed derive the PDA to sign for token transfers, any `pool` account could sign for the transfer of tokens from a `vault` token account to an arbitrary `withdraw_destination`.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount};

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod pda_sharing_insecure {
    use super::*;

    pub fn withdraw_tokens(ctx: Context<WithdrawTokens>) -> Result<()> {
        let amount = ctx.accounts.vault.amount;
        let seeds = &[ctx.accounts.pool.mint.as_ref(), &[ctx.accounts.pool.bump]];
        token::transfer(ctx.accounts.transfer_ctx().with_signer(&[seeds]), amount)
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    #[account(has_one = vault, has_one = withdraw_destination)]
    pool: Account<'info, TokenPool>,
    vault: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    withdraw_destination: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    authority: AccountInfo<'info>,
    token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}

impl<'info> WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    pub fn transfer_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, token::Transfer<'info>> {
        let program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        let accounts = token::Transfer {
            from: self.vault.to_account_info(),
            to: self.withdraw_destination.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.authority.to_account_info(),
        };
        CpiContext::new(program, accounts)
    }
}

#[account]
pub struct TokenPool {
    vault: Pubkey,
    mint: Pubkey,
    withdraw_destination: Pubkey,
    bump: u8,
}
```

## Secure account specific PDA

One approach to create an account specific PDA is to use the `withdraw_destination` as a seed to derive the PDA used as the authority of the `vault` token account. This ensures the PDA signing for the CPI in the `withdraw_tokens` instruction is derived using the intended `withdraw_destination` token account. In other words, tokens from a `vault` token account can only be withdrawn to the `withdraw_destination` that was originally initialized with the `pool` account.

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount};

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod pda_sharing_secure {
    use super::*;

    pub fn withdraw_tokens(ctx: Context<WithdrawTokens>) -> Result<()> {
        let amount = ctx.accounts.vault.amount;
        let seeds = &[
            ctx.accounts.pool.withdraw_destination.as_ref(),
            &[ctx.accounts.pool.bump],
        ];
        token::transfer(ctx.accounts.transfer_ctx().with_signer(&[seeds]), amount)
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    #[account(has_one = vault, has_one = withdraw_destination)]
    pool: Account<'info, TokenPool>,
    vault: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    withdraw_destination: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    authority: AccountInfo<'info>,
    token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}

impl<'info> WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    pub fn transfer_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, token::Transfer<'info>> {
        let program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        let accounts = token::Transfer {
            from: self.vault.to_account_info(),
            to: self.withdraw_destination.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.authority.to_account_info(),
        };
        CpiContext::new(program, accounts)
    }
}

#[account]
pub struct TokenPool {
    vault: Pubkey,
    mint: Pubkey,
    withdraw_destination: Pubkey,
    bump: u8,
}
```

## Anchor’s `seeds` and `bump` constraints

PDAs can be used as both the address of an account and allow programs to sign for the PDAs they own.

The example below uses a PDA derived using the `withdraw_destination` as both the address of the `pool` account and owner of the `vault` token account. This means that only the `pool` account associated with correct `vault` and `withdraw_destination` can be used in the `withdraw_tokens` instruction.

You can use Anchor’s `seeds` and `bump` constraints with the `#[account(...)]` attribute to validate the `pool` account PDA. Anchor derives a PDA using the `seeds` and `bump` specified and compare against the account passed into the instruction as the `pool` account. The `has_one` constraint is used to further ensure that only the correct accounts stored on the `pool` account are passed into the instruction. 

```rust
use anchor_lang::prelude::*;
use anchor_spl::token::{self, Token, TokenAccount};

declare_id!("Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS");

#[program]
pub mod pda_sharing_recommended {
    use super::*;

    pub fn withdraw_tokens(ctx: Context<WithdrawTokens>) -> Result<()> {
        let amount = ctx.accounts.vault.amount;
        let seeds = &[
            ctx.accounts.pool.withdraw_destination.as_ref(),
            &[ctx.accounts.pool.bump],
        ];
        token::transfer(ctx.accounts.transfer_ctx().with_signer(&[seeds]), amount)
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    #[account(
				has_one = vault,
				has_one = withdraw_destination,
				seeds = [withdraw_destination.key().as_ref()],
				bump = pool.bump,
		)]
    pool: Account<'info, TokenPool>,
    vault: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    withdraw_destination: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}

impl<'info> WithdrawTokens<'info> {
    pub fn transfer_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, token::Transfer<'info>> {
        let program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        let accounts = token::Transfer {
            from: self.vault.to_account_info(),
            to: self.withdraw_destination.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.pool.to_account_info(),
        };
        CpiContext::new(program, accounts)
    }
}

#[account]
pub struct TokenPool {
    vault: Pubkey,
    mint: Pubkey,
    withdraw_destination: Pubkey,
    bump: u8,
}
```

# Demo

Let’s practice by creating a simple program to demonstrate how a PDA sharing can allow an attacker to withdraw tokens that don’t belong to them. This demo expands on the examples above by including the instructions to initialize the required program accounts.

### 1. Starter

To get started, download the starter code on the `starter` branch of [this repository](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-pda-sharing/tree/starter). The starter code includes a program with two instructions and the boilerplate setup for the test file.

The `initialize_pool` instruction initializes a new `TokenPool` that stores a `vault`, `mint`, `withdraw_destination`, and `bump`. The `vault` is a token account where the authority is set as a PDA derived using the `mint` address.

The `withdraw_insecure` instruction will transfer tokens in the `vault` token account to a `withdraw_destination` token account. 

However, as written the seeds used for signing are not specific to the vault's withdraw destination, thus opening up the program to security exploits. Take a minute to familiarize yourself with the code before continuing on.

### 2. Test `withdraw_insecure` instruction

The test file includes the code to invoke the `initialize_pool` instruction and then mint 100 tokens to the `vault` token account. It also includes a test to invoke the `withdraw_insecure` using the intended `withdraw_destination`. This shows that the instructions can be used as intended.

After that, there are two more tests to show how the instructions are vulnerable to exploit.

The first test invokes the `initialize_pool` instruction to create a "fake" `pool` account using the same `vault` token account, but a different `withdraw_destination`.

The second test withdraws from this pool, effectively stealing funds from the vault.

```tsx
it("Insecure initialize allows pool to be initialized with wrong vault", async () => {
    await program.methods
      .initializePool(authInsecureBump)
      .accounts({
        pool: poolInsecureFake.publicKey,
        mint: mint,
        vault: vaultInsecure.address,
        withdrawDestination: withdrawDestinationFake,
        payer: walletFake.publicKey,
      })
      .signers([walletFake, poolInsecureFake])
      .rpc()

    await new Promise((x) => setTimeout(x, 1000))

    await spl.mintTo(
      connection,
      wallet.payer,
      mint,
      vaultInsecure.address,
      wallet.payer,
      100
    )

    const account = await spl.getAccount(connection, vaultInsecure.address)
    expect(Number(account.amount)).to.equal(100)
})

it("Insecure withdraw allows stealing from vault", async () => {
    await program.methods
      .withdrawInsecure()
      .accounts({
        pool: poolInsecureFake.publicKey,
        vault: vaultInsecure.address,
        withdrawDestination: withdrawDestinationFake,
        authority: authInsecure,
        signer: walletFake.publicKey,
      })
      .signers([walletFake])
      .rpc()

    const account = await spl.getAccount(connection, vaultInsecure.address)
    expect(Number(account.amount)).to.equal(0)
})
```

Run `anchor test` to see that the transactions complete successfully and the `withdraw_instrucure` instruction allows the `vault` token account to be drained to a fake withdraw destination stored on the fake `pool` account.

### 3. Add `initialize_pool_secure` instruction

Now let's add a new instruction to the program for securely initializing a pool. 

This new `initialize_pool_secure` instruction will initialize a `pool` account as a PDA derived using the `withdraw_destination`. It will also initialize a `vault` token account with the authority set as the `pool` PDA.

```rust
pub fn initialize_pool_secure(ctx: Context<InitializePoolSecure>) -> Result<()> {
    ctx.accounts.pool.vault = ctx.accounts.vault.key();
    ctx.accounts.pool.mint = ctx.accounts.mint.key();
    ctx.accounts.pool.withdraw_destination = ctx.accounts.withdraw_destination.key();
    ctx.accounts.pool.bump = *ctx.bumps.get("pool").unwrap();
    Ok(())
}

...

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct InitializePoolSecure<'info> {
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = payer,
        space = 8 + 32 + 32 + 32 + 1,
        seeds = [withdraw_destination.key().as_ref()],
        bump
    )]
    pub pool: Account<'info, TokenPool>,
    pub mint: Account<'info, Mint>,
    #[account(
        init,
        payer = payer,
        token::mint = mint,
        token::authority = pool,
    )]
    pub vault: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    pub withdraw_destination: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub payer: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
    pub token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
    pub rent: Sysvar<'info, Rent>,
}
```

### 4. Add `withdraw_secure` instruction

Next, add a `withdraw_secure` instruction. This instruction will withdraw tokens from the `vault` token account to the `withdraw_destination`. The `pool` account is validated using the `seeds` and `bump` constraints to ensure the correct PDA account is provided. The `has_one` constraints check that the correct `vault` and `withdraw_destination` token accounts are provided. 

```rust
pub fn withdraw_secure(ctx: Context<WithdrawTokensSecure>) -> Result<()> {
    let amount = ctx.accounts.vault.amount;
    let seeds = &[
    ctx.accounts.pool.withdraw_destination.as_ref(),
      &[ctx.accounts.pool.bump],
    ];
    token::transfer(ctx.accounts.transfer_ctx().with_signer(&[seeds]), amount)
}

...

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct WithdrawTokensSecure<'info> {
    #[account(
        has_one = vault,
        has_one = withdraw_destination,
        seeds = [withdraw_destination.key().as_ref()],
        bump = pool.bump,
    )]
    pool: Account<'info, TokenPool>,
    #[account(mut)]
    vault: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    #[account(mut)]
    withdraw_destination: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    token_program: Program<'info, Token>,
}

impl<'info> WithdrawTokensSecure<'info> {
    pub fn transfer_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, token::Transfer<'info>> {
        let program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        let accounts = token::Transfer {
            from: self.vault.to_account_info(),
            to: self.withdraw_destination.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.pool.to_account_info(),
        };
        CpiContext::new(program, accounts)
    }
}
```

### 5. Test `withdraw_secure` instruction

Finally, return to the test file to test the `withdraw_secure` instruction and show that by narrowing the scope of our PDA signing authority, we've removed the vulnerability.

Before we write a test showing the vulnerability has been patched let's write a test that simply shows that the initialization and withdraw instructions work as expected:

```typescript
it("Secure pool initialization and withdraw works", async () => {
    const withdrawDestinationAccount = await getAccount(
      provider.connection,
      withdrawDestination
    )

    await program.methods
      .initializePoolSecure()
      .accounts({
        pool: authSecure,
        mint: mint,
        vault: vaultRecommended.publicKey,
        withdrawDestination: withdrawDestination,
      })
      .signers([vaultRecommended])
      .rpc()

    await new Promise((x) => setTimeout(x, 1000))

    await spl.mintTo(
      connection,
      wallet.payer,
      mint,
      vaultRecommended.publicKey,
      wallet.payer,
      100
    )

    await program.methods
      .withdrawSecure()
      .accounts({
        pool: authSecure,
        vault: vaultRecommended.publicKey,
        withdrawDestination: withdrawDestination,
      })
      .rpc()

    const afterAccount = await getAccount(
      provider.connection,
      withdrawDestination
    )

    expect(
      Number(afterAccount.amount) - Number(withdrawDestinationAccount.amount)
    ).to.equal(100)
})
```

Now, we'll test that the exploit no longer works. Since the `vault` authority is the `pool` PDA derived using the intended `withdraw_destination` token account, there should no longer be a way to withdraw to an account other than the intended `withdraw_destination`.

Add a test that shows you can't call `withdraw_secure` with the wrong withdrawal destination. It can use the pool and vault created in the previous test.

```typescript
  it("Secure withdraw doesn't allow withdraw to wrong destination", async () => {
    try {
      await program.methods
        .withdrawSecure()
        .accounts({
          pool: authSecure,
          vault: vaultRecommended.publicKey,
          withdrawDestination: withdrawDestinationFake,
        })
        .signers([walletFake])
        .rpc()

      assert.fail("expected error")
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error.message)
      expect(error)
    }
  })
```

Lastly, since the `pool` account is a PDA derived using the `withdraw_destination` token account, we can’t create a fake `pool` account using the same PDA. Add one more test showing that the new `initialize_pool_secure` instruction won't let an attacker put in the wrong vault.

```typescript
it("Secure pool initialization doesn't allow wrong vault", async () => {
    try {
      await program.methods
        .initializePoolSecure()
        .accounts({
          pool: authSecure,
          mint: mint,
          vault: vaultInsecure.address,
          withdrawDestination: withdrawDestination,
        })
        .signers([vaultRecommended])
        .rpc()

      assert.fail("expected error")
    } catch (error) {
      console.log(error.message)
      expect(error)
    }
})
```

Run `anchor test` and to see that the new instructions don't allow an attacker to withdraw from a vault that isn't theirs.

```
  pda-sharing
    ✔ Initialize Pool Insecure (981ms)
    ✔ Withdraw (470ms)
    ✔ Insecure initialize allows pool to be initialized with wrong vault (10983ms)
    ✔ Insecure withdraw allows stealing from vault (492ms)
    ✔ Secure pool initialization and withdraw works (2502ms)
unknown signer: ARjxAsEPj6YsAPKaBfd1AzUHbNPtAeUsqusAmBchQTfV
    ✔ Secure withdraw doesn't allow withdraw to wrong destination
unknown signer: GJcHJLot3whbY1aC9PtCsBYk5jWoZnZRJPy5uUwzktAY
    ✔ Secure pool initialization doesn't allow wrong vault
```

And that's it! Unlike some of the other security vulnerabilities we've discussed, this one is more conceptual and can't be fixed by simply using a particular Anchor type. You'll need to think through the architecture of your program and ensure that you aren't sharing PDAs across different domains.

If you want to take a look at the final solution code you can find it on the `solution` branch of [the same repository](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-pda-sharing/tree/solution).

# Challenge

Just as with other lessons in this module, your opportunity to practice avoiding this security exploit lies in auditing your own or other programs.

Take some time to review at least one program and look for potential vulnerabilities in its PDA structure. PDAs used for signing should be narrow and focused on a single domain as much as possible.

Remember, if you find a bug or exploit in somebody else's program, please alert them! If you find one in your own program, be sure to patch it right away.
