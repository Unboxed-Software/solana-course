# Introduction to Module 2

Welcome to Module 2! In this module, we'll be delving into the world of tokens and exploring how to work with them from the client-side. Tokens are an integral part of the blockchain ecosystem, representing various forms of digital assets, including cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and utility tokens. They enable a wide range of applications, from decentralized finance (DeFi) to digital art and collectibles.

In this module, our goal is to provide you with a solid understanding of what tokens are and the different ways they can be used within the Solana ecosystem. We'll be guiding you through the process of interacting with common Solana programs, such as the Token Program, the Token Swap Program, and Metaplex for creating NFTs. By the end of this module, you'll be well-equipped to work with tokens in your own projects.

The lessons in this module are designed to be independent, allowing you to explore the topics at your own pace and in your preferred order. While some lessons may build upon the concepts learned in previous ones, you can always revisit any topic to refresh your understanding.
