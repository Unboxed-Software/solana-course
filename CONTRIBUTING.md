# Contributing to the Course

Hey, thanks for contributing!

## How Can I Contribute?

Content presentation is controlled by the config file `course-structure.json`. All content is in the `content` directory sorted by the slug in `course-structure.json`. Static assets are in the `assets` directory.

### Adding Content

If you'd like to add content, please start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-course/issues/new) and tagging @jamesrp13 to discuss your reasoning, plan, and timeline.

Once a plan has been discussed and agreed to, you can start working on content. When you're done, create a PR to the `draft` branch.

Create new modules in the same format as the existing modules - see [Getting Started](./content/getting-started.md)
### Editing Existing Content

If you want to fix a typo or otherwise improve on existing content, follow a similar process as with adding content:

1. [Create an issue](https://github.com/Unboxed-Software/solana-course/issues/new) and/or comment on an existing issue to state you've started working
2. Create a PR to the `draft` branch during or when complete

### Guidelines

Use language consistent with [TERMINOLOGY](https://github.com/solana-foundation/developer-content/blob/main/docs/terminology.md). In particular:

- Use 'secret key' rather than 'private key'.
- Use 'wallet app' for software. 'wallet' for the address that holds value.
- Use 'SOL' rather than 'Sol' to refer to Solana's native token
- PDAs are not public keys. It is not possible to have a public key without a secret key. A public key is derived from a secret key, and it is not possible to generate a public key without first generating a secret key.
- Use the specific term 'associated token account' if that's what you're referring to, same for 'token mint account'. A ['token account' is any account formatted to hold tokens](https://solana.stackexchange.com/questions/7507/what-is-the-difference-between-a-token-account-and-an-associated-token-account), and being specific (rather than say swapping between 'associated token account' and 'token account' makes this clearer.
- Use apostrophe of possession, [including for inanimate objects](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/1031/is-using-the-possessive-s-correct-in-the-cars-antenna). Eg 'the account's balance' is correct.

Code examples should be formatted as follows:

- JS/TS - two spaces per prettier defaults, StandardJS, node style guide, idiomatic JS, AirBnB style guide, MDN, Google Style guide, codepen, jsfiddle, etc.
- Rust: four spaces per rustfmt

Diagrams:
- If you draw Solana elliptic curves, these are [Edwards curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwards_curve)
- Use SVG so diagrams look good on different resolutions
- We like [Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/) for diagrams
 
Note that while `prettier` can format Markdown, [prettier doesn't support language-specific settings inside Markdown files](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/5378) so you'll need to format the code yourself for now.

## Committing

We are using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
for this repository.

General flow for making a contribution:

1. Fork the repo on GitHub
2. Clone the project to your own machine
3. Check out the `draft` branch
4. Make a new branch based on `draft` and add your contributions
5. Push your work back up to your fork on GitHub
6. Submit a Pull request so that we can review your changes

## Config

Content is controlled by the config file `course-structure.json`. All content is in the `content` dir sorted by the slug in `course-structure.json`.

## Writing Content for this Guide

Use the terms at https://docs.solana.com/terminology

## Static Assets

Static assets are in `assets`. This is set in `svelte.config.js` to match the older soldev-ui directory. 

![Some alt text](../assets/somefile.svg)

Use SVG where possible (they'll look better on different screens). You ca get an SVG export from Whimsical by appending `/svg` to the end of a Whimsical URL.
## Components

Components are individual Svelte files, in the `/src/lib/components` directory.

Routes (pages) are in `/src/lib/routes`

## Development

```
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

### Localization

In order for the course structure to be maintained, localized files need to adhere to the following rules:

1. Localized lesson files should be in a subdirectory of `content` named after the language abbreviation. For example, lessons translated into Spanish should be housed in `content/es`.
2. Localized asset files should be in a subdirectory of `assets` named after the language abbreviation. For example, assets localized into Spanish should be housed in `assets/es`.
3. File names for localized files must be identical to their English counterpart. To be clear, _do not translate file names_. The file name is used as the slug for the article and must be identical between languages.
